Castle of Shadows is a 2D pixel-art puzzle adventure about escaping the darkness within your own mind.
You awaken trapped in a mysterious castle where the only way forward is to answer questions about mental health.
Explore, solve riddles, collect clues, and uncover the truth behind the shadows.

## Gameplay
Move: WASD

Interact: Touch the chest or door

Open chests to answer mental health questions.

Each correct answer reveals part of a password.

Special chests grant torchlight to navigate dark areas.

Collect all password digits to unlock the door and proceed.

Progression: 2 levels (to be continued), each more challenging, ending in your escape from the Castle.

## Story
“You are trapped in the Castle of Shadows. The castle is your mind.
Only by understanding yourself can you escape.”
Throughout your journey, you’ll uncover Memory Fragments — haunting, incomplete pieces of your past — that reveal why you’re here.

## Objective
The game blends atmospheric exploration with educational elements about mental health awareness, aiming to entertain while encouraging reflection and conversation.
